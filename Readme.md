# Code Enforcement Violations San Diego

In 2016 there was a lot of discussion in the press about the backlog of Code Enforcement violations.
I thought I can make a small analysis if that was the case and this site is the result of that analysis.

## Development

This repo uses middleman a static site generator built with ruby.

### Installation
Install required libraries (middleman via bundler) javascript tools via npm

```
bundle install
npm install
```

### Run

```
middleman
```

Open `localhost:4567` and you see the site.
